                <h3>3. Our Services</h3>
                <p>foneverify – User Authentication platform for identifying genuine users. foneverify is a mobile authentication tool which is meant for developers to verify user’s phone numbers, with one simple integration developers can verify numbers in 200+ countries & pay only for successful verifications.</p>
                <ul class="treetirelist">
                    <li>
                        <strong>We have two calls flows</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>SMS – SMS: SMS Primary and SMS Fall-back</li>
                            <li>SMS – VOICE: SMS Primary and Voice Fall-back</li>

                        <strong>There are two modes of verification; SMS and VOICE</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>SMS mode: </b> Client application initiates verification request with end-user’s MSISDN to foneverify system. In turn foneverify system allocates an OTP to this MSISDN and sends this OTP to the end user (MSISDN) via SMS. Client application picks or user manually types in the received OTP. Application sends back this OTP to the foneverify system. foneverify matches the received OTP with the one it has allocated to this MSISDN from which verification request has been initiated.</li>
                            <li><b>VOICE mode :</b> Client application initiates verification request with end-user’s MSISDN to foneverify system. In turn foneverify system allocates a DID (Direct Inward Dialing Number) to this MSISDN and sends this DID number to application in API’s response. The Application prompts the same to the End user. The end-user then manually gives (or application automatically initiates) a missed call to the allocated DID. foneverify system acknowledges the missed call and matches the combination of caller number (MSISDN) and called number (DID Number).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <strong>
                            Primary to Secondary Fall-back:
                            Based on Application Vendor’s requirements one of the modes can be assigned as primary mode of verification and another as fall-back. For e.g. a vendor could chose to have SMS as the primary mode of verification and voice as secondary. In such a scenario in case the SMS verification fails to happen in a predefined time window then the end user will be automatically switched to the voice verification flow & a DID number will be assigned to him.

                <p class="text-justify"><strong>A. Good Faith efforts to resolve disputes.</strong> If either party intends to seek arbitration under this Agreement, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance of initiating the arbitration. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If you and we are unable to resolve our dispute within thirty (30) days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration in accordance with the following terms.</p>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>B. Arbitration.</strong> YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR, IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. The location of arbitration will be in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in a lawsuit, and other rights that you and we would have in court may not be available in arbitration. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration, or bring claims under class, representative, private attorney general or similar theories of liability or prayers for relief for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a class action, private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees and costs.</p>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>C. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</strong>This Agreement shall be interpreted, enforced and governed in all respects by the laws of India and under exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of India. The Parties shall use their efforts in good faith to settle by way of direct negotiations any difference, which may arise between them in connection with this Agreement. All unresolved disputes will be subject to Arbitration and conducted in accordance with the rules of Indian Arbitration Centers. </p>
