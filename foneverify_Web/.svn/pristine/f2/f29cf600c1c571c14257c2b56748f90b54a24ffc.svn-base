You can test the application for up to 10 successful verifications. Once the testing is successful and you are satisfied with the results,  create new apps under add apps section, a new app ID and secret key would be shared with you; then proceed to “Make Payments” section and buy credits for verification.</p>

                                    How can I shore up conversions; i.e. number of users verifying successfully against number of user attempts made?

                                            foneverify is designed to maximize conversions. Apart from verification via OTP (one time password) sent through SMS, we enable verification via DID (Direct Inward Dialling) number. You can combine the two modes, or use one mode alone; depending on the market you serve, historical data, user behaviour etc. Your selections can significantly influence the % of conversions.

                                            By default, foneverify blocks an attempt to initiate another verify request for the same number while there is already one ongoing –therefore DO NOT implement a retry button with another verify call – this would be rejected outright.

                                            The sender ID of SMS is uniform across all our developers.

                                            Switchover to fallback takes place as soon as update verification request is received from client application after initial timeout expires.

                                            foneverify system provides DID number back to client application through API response. It is the responsibility of application developers to display this DID to end users through respective views. The DID number will be displayed on the screen of the device. In case of mobile the number will be displayed on the device screen for user to give a missed call and in case of desktop, the DID number is displayed on the website for the user to give a missed call on that number.

                                            The user can be verified more than once depending upon the different verification cycle(s).

                                            Once application is registered with FoneVerify account, a system generated unique appKey and app ID gets generated which is shared with developer.

                                            Country code input is necessary. Our system requires an ISO two character country code for example IN for India which the application interface which can either show as a drop down or ask the user to type in the country code.
